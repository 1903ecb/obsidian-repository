The journey between understanding access to information in a physical space and its affect on history: 

- [[info in physical space]] 
-  [[Jan 23, W3 notes]] 
- [[Enigma Machine, Numberphile]] 
- [[infrastructure to support info]] 
- [[future society]] 
- [[lines of history]]



Through this course, two of the most prominent take aways I have learned can be illustrated in the ideas notes, [[info in physical space]] and [[lines of history]]. 

The idea of information existing in a physical space pertains specifically to the notion that, before the internet, all information that was expressed in a medium outside your own head, was represented via a tangible material thing. This means that if you have access to that physical material, you have access to that information. This was an especially powerful idea considering that in our modern society, so much information (government classified documents, private or personal information) is hidden behind invisible internet barriers, never to be accessed by most people. This is why the idea that if you puytyourself in the same physical space where material information exists, you can have access to that information. 

There are several instances throughout the lectures and my own research are especially prevelant. This concept is intially presented in the lectures on [[Jan 23, W3 notes]] with the introduction of cryptography. The second instance this year that further solididies the idea of [[info in physical space]] is also related to cryptography and comes from the [[Enigma Machine, Numberphile]] source. This video explains how, in German submarines during world war 2, people who were tasked with sending encrypted messages would receive pieces of paper with the combinations to decrypt codes for that month. There were several occasions in which people from the British military got access to these pieces of paper which would temporaily enable them to crack these encrypted messages. 

In the case of crytography of WW2, there was singnificant infrastructure created to convey and encrypt information. This is but one example of my ideas note pertaining to [[infrastructure to support info]]. This note details how socities and organizations have devoted resources to the exchange of knowledge and subsiquently created jobs, cities, and even entire economies devoted to the spread of information and the infrastrucutre requrired to make that process possible. Often the development of infrastructure comes from a specific need, whether that be wanting to connect people across great distances or wanting to win a war of sell a product.  As outlined in the [[future society]] notes, there is a significant interplay between how the needs of people affect the technology being developed, and how the technology being developed affects society. Ultimately, the development of technology affects the [[lines of history]] that are created by people through the physical material being put into the world and through the infrastructure being created to support the transmission of this information. Finally, the motivation that people have for creating technology affects how their society functions in the future and the history that they will eventually leave behind.
