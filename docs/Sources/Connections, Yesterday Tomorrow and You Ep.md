Personal thoughts: 

I personally have I'm not the biggest fan of this show. Although the narrator and creater of the program states that the development of technology is more complicated than a linear path, I think the way he goes about describing history is overly simplified. Specifically, I think the characterization of technology directly developing from other inventions is paints a overly deterministic perspective of history that does more damage to the viewers perspective.
