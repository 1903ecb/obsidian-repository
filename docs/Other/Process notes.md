*** are we supposed to have an ideas note for everything single idea we have and link them all together 

or 

are we just supposed to highlight to ideas that are common themes within the majority of our notes and connect those ideas 

if you really wanted to you could link every single idea from this class and every single idea we read about can be linked together if you try hard enough 

thoughts after office hours meeting 
- I was infact mistaken and this is not as all encompasing as I feared 

tiering notes 
- what i read / learned 
- what the person said 
- what i thought 

- my question is: 
	- if im pulling my own ideas from the concept notes of other people, 
	- use hashtags perhaps 

i currently have many ideas in the "info in physical space" link in the notes 
- it includes a variety of ideas all under that category but they're all different enough that they could possibly be their own label 
- i might go back and make more specific labels in order to make more specific connections between notes 

- however i will likely save this process for later because i have more pressing things to do first 

- do youtube videos count as one of the 5 sources?
