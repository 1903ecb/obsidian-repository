This is my memex!

My notes are categorized into `HIST notes` , `Ideas`, `Sources` , `Other` , 

`HIST notes` perptain to my lecture notes, `Sources` pertain to external research, and `Ideas` are the general themes that connect lecture content to external research and my own thoughts

What I have added since Memex 2: 

All `HIST notes` created after March 8th are new. 

I have added the new ideas note [[war develops tech]]

I've updated the [[Ideas for research]] note

I am  aware that I do not have 15 sources for this memex. However, I have added 5 new sources ( [[Ether Or, exurb1a video]] , [[Dark Territory review]] , [[How a simple ‘hello’ became the first message sent via the Internet]] , [[How the space race built today's technology]] , [[Enigma Machine, Numberphile]] ) since the last memex.
