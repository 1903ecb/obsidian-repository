Mediums and Messages 

Impact of messages over different mediums 
- cave paintings 
	- some info about animal tracking only available inside a cave, special significance of message due to accessibility 
[[info in physical space]]

New ways of being eliminate old ways 
- cars and city infrastructure 
	- loosing the benefits of technology 
	- can't walk anywhere 
[[ space n time]]

Classification 
- reflects and directs thinking, the way we order represents the way we think 

mediums we use extent our human cognition 
- extending into the future 

writing emerging out of need to count 

people who hold the thing with the writing holds the power 
- libraries 
- infrastructure required to maintain ancient librairies 
	- complex system
	- [[complex vs complicated]]

early writing wasn't spoke 
- required interpretation of beholder to decipher / understand 

interactions between traveling groups of people lead to the transmition and alteration of languages 

library fell into roman interpretation of refined pleasure 
- conspicuous consumption / higher order entertainment 
- organized by genre and author 

So far... 
- the medium itself is as important as message 
	- how we access it and how it affects our world view 
		- the physical substance of a message affects how we use it 
			- ex: you might not right the same thing on snapchat as you would carve on stone 
			- not wanting to paint with fancy paint etc...
- how we classify media reflects power, control, discipline
- infrastructure of writing affects society 
- libraries reflect the world back to itself 
	- book banning 
- no natural way to organize anything 
	- the choice of how to organize is a reflection of how the organizer thinks?
