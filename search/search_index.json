This means that if you have access to that physical material, you have access to that information. This was an especially powerful idea considering that in our modern society, so much information (government classified documents, private or personal information) is hidden behind invisible internet barriers, never to be accessed by most people. This is why the idea that if you puytyourself in the same physical space where material information exists, you can have access to that information. </p> <p>There are several instances throughout the lectures and my own research are especially prevelant. This concept is intially presented in the lectures on Jan 23, W3 notes with the introduction of cryptography. The second instance this year that further solididies the idea of info in physical space is also related to cryptography and comes from the Enigma Machine, Numberphile source. This video explains how, in German submarines during world war 2, people who were tasked with sending encrypted messages would receive pieces of paper with the combinations to decrypt codes for that month. There were several occasions in which people from the British military got access to these pieces of paper which would temporaily enable them to crack these encrypted messages. </p> <p>In the case of crytography of WW2, there was singnificant infrastructure created to convey and encrypt information. This is but one example of my ideas note pertaining to infrastructure to support info. This note details how socities and organizations have devoted resources to the exchange of knowledge and subsiquently created jobs, cities, and even entire economies devoted to the spread of information and the infrastrucutre requrired to make that process possible. Often the development of infrastructure comes from a specific need, whether that be wanting to connect people across great distances or wanting to win a war of sell a product.  As outlined in the future society notes, there is a significant interplay between how the needs of people affect the technology being developed, and how the technology being developed affects society. Ultimately, the development of technology affects the lines of history that are created by people through the physical material being put into the world and through the infrastructure being created to support the transmission of this information. Finally, the motivation that people have for creating technology affects how their society functions in the future and the history that they will eventually leave behind. </p>"},{"location":"0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>Going into this class, my goal was to learn about the internet. My expectation were to delve into brief period of time, likely starting the around early 1900-1930s during the development of computer and before the internet. I was hoping to learn how drastically our world has changed as a result of the development of these technologies and what life was like before. I was really interested in learning about the space race, the social and politcal climate affecting this change, and eventually the various design choices that were made when developing the internet. I  understand that this course was design to give us a broad overview of the development of technology and communications system, the way in whcih this information in this class was conveyed left me extremely disengaged.  I do believe that the course content affected my learning outcomes to a degree beyond my control. Maybe I was supposed to provide myself with more of   oppurtunities to do reseach and to learn about the internet. But I think to a certain extent, it is reasonable to suggest that disengament from one's own learning is likley the outcome for many individuals from this class and that it is the result of the course itself rather than individual failing. I didn't take advatange of the oppurtunities afforded to me because I wasn't prepared to teach myself the content I expected to be taught as part of this course.  </p> <p>Due to the sheer amount of seemingly unrelated content and the amount of time we spent coverying it, I believe that this course ended up being fundamentally misleading  . Instead, we covered the development of the silk loom Jan 30, W4 notes, the telegraph Feb 1, W4 notes, and eventually the first computers March 8, W8 notes. As a result I was disengaged and felt that putting in additional effort to teach myself about the history of the internet was not worth my time. I would like to add that I missed several of the classes at the end of the semester. The classes that I missed also consisted of the bulk courses content about the internet. To conclude, I fully recognize that some of my issues in not learning about the internet come as a result of my own disengagement from this course. </p>"},{"location":"HIST%20notes/Feb%201%2C%20W4%20notes/","title":"created_by_me","text":"<p>describtive tags, same work will automatically link</p> <p>what makes a person alive or not alive  -

Although the narrator and creater of the program states that the development of technology is more complicated than a linear path, I think the way he goes about describing history is overly simplified. Specifically, I think the characterization of technology directly developing from other inventions is paints a overly deterministic perspective of history that does more damage to the viewers perspective. </p>"},{"location":"Sources/Dark%20Territory%20review/","title":"created_by_me","text":"<p>Kaiser, Charles. \u201cDark Territory Review \u2013 How Wargames and Reagan Shaped Us Cyberwar Battle.\u201d The Guardian, Guardian News and Media, 20 Mar. 2016, https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/20/dark-territory-review-ronald-reagan-matthew-broderick-war-games-american-cyberwar.</p> <p>Description:  This article details a book that was written about the real world connection between the movie WarGames and American cybertechnology.
